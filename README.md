# Contributions to RabbitHole Metagovernance

Most of these docs were created as supplementals to assist other contributors. They're hosted for your convenience on GitBook.

You probably won't find what you're looking for here unless you're working in the MGP and looking for some specific piece of content to use.\

Please see [RabbitHole's Metagovernance Workspace on Notion](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Metagovernance-Pod-PUBLIC-6157961d6edc45c7863bf405e183551f) for more information.

### Education Workstream Contributions

#### Voting Activity Archive

In order to fulfill two related goals under the Education Workstream's "Curation" mandate, I built an open-source archive of all v0 Voting activity.

While this library is used only for voting activity, it can easily be expanded to store and display any Education Workstream content. Instructions and templates for maintaining the archive are included.

### Cross-Stream Contributions

#### Pod-Wide Documentation Library

In response to advice from our forerunners in the web3 metagovernance space and feedback from the RabbitHole community, I built a single, easy-to-use documentation resource for metagovernance information at RabbitHole.
