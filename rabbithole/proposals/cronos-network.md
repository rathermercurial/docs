### About Cronos (Crypto.org) Chain

> Cronos is an open-source project launched by Crypto.org that brings together many open-source initiatives of the Ethereum, Cosmos and IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) ecosystems. At its core, it is a fully EVM-compatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (Ethermint implementation).

> Cronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340,000 DeFi and NFT users. Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency, which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by Crypto.com . All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment, called Cronoscan , as well as on Defillama for TVL data .

### About Cosmos Network

Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent, parallel blockchains, each powered by Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithms which allows developers to deploy autonomous, application-specific blockchains in a secure and interoperable environment.

> In other words, Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other. There are currently more than 262 apps and services in the Cosmos network, including Binance Chain, Terra, Crypto.org, and Cosmos Hub, with over $139 billion of digital assets under management..

> At the core of the Internet of Blockchains is the Cosmos Hub, the economic center of Cosmos, secured by its native ATOM token. The Cosmos Hub is designed to be a service provider to the chains that connect to itâ€”a vast decentralized marketplace that provides a wealth of value-added services, such as shared security, a decentralized interchain exchange, bridges to Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), and secure custodianship of digital assets.
