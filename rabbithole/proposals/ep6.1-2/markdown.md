## EP6.1 - Proposal to Terminate Director of Operations Brantly Millegan at the ENS Foundation

EP6.1 is set forth to trigger the termination of Brantly Millegan as the Director of The ENS Foundation under the [Clause 15 of the Articles of Association of The ENS Foundation paragraph titled ‘Directors’ 4] which states that:

"The Council has the power, exercisable by notice to the Foundation Company, to appoint or remove one or more Directors of the Foundation Company."

### Recommendation for EP6.1

The comments made by Brantly and the response to questioning about the comments do not align with the values of RabbitHole or what we believe to be the values of the broader ENS community.  We want Web3 to be a welcoming place where everyone feels they can learn and participate.

While Brantly was a valuable contributor to the ENS protocol, as a representative of the ENS Foundation, Brantly's statements and response have harmed members of the ENS community. His failure to address the harm done to the ENS community is a failure of his responsibilities as a leader of that community.

We recommend voting “For” to remove Brantly as Director of the ENS foundation, considering the above factors. While our recommendation is to remove Brantly from this position, we believe it is critical to find a replacement for the Directorship position, as soon as possible. Ep 6.2 nominates three potential replacement directors and we plan to vote on this proposal as well.

## ENS: EP6.2 Election of a new Director of The ENS Foundation

EP 6.2 puts forward a list of nominees to replace Brantly in the ENS Foundation Directorship, [The nominees can be found here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/nominations-for-ens-foundation-director-to-replace-brantly-eth/10634/11).

### Recommendation for EP6.2

We recommended voting to replace Brantly via proposal EP 6.1. We believe it is important to provide a replacement for this role as soon as possible. We believe that AvsA is the most qualified candidate and has demonstrated valuable contributions to the web3 and ENS ecosystem while holding high level positions of trust.
