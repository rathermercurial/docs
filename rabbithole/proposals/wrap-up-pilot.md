#### EP6.1: Removal of Brantly Millegan as Director of The ENS Foundation

[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xa9a2dc5a52ea54b478c4c5fea88540622dff7ad5000f8d146dff482c6e6b6055) | [Discussion](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep6-1-social-removal-of-brantly-millegan-as-director-of-the-ens-foundation/11092/4)

**RabbitHole Community Votes:** 14 Yes / 0 No\
**Metagovernance Pod Votes:** 18 Yes / 0 No

RabbitHole metagovernance has voted to terminate Brantley Milligan due to the re-surfacing of hateful remarks that he made in 2016, which he then adamantly defended in a twitter space. The remarks made by Brantley do not reflect our overall vision of inclusivity at RabbitHole, and thus we voted for his termination as Director of Operations at The ENS Foundation

#### EP6.2: Election of a new Director of The ENS Foundation

[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xc4bc562d32e59a528dec301261e8d2b3b0c6880c2b782201c2e9f1ff3979d165) | [Discussion](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep6-2-social-election-of-a-new-director-of-the-ens-foundation/11093)

**RabbitHole Community Votes:** 16 Yes / 0 No\
**Metagovernance Pod Votes:** 20 Yes / 0 No

Following the vote to remove Brantley as Director of Operations at The ENS foundation, RabbitHole metagovernance found it necessary to have a say in his successor. RabbitHole voted in favor of AvsA taking over the role in replacement of Brantley. Avsa has shown great loyalty to ENS, and thus we saw her as an excellent fit for the job!

## PoolTogether

#### PTIP-59: EPNS Partnership & Exec Team Mandate

[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/pooltogether.eth/proposal/0x3d2b8ffd9cc18e679d8f99aa4ca9418f3640f21eca893e07bcb17390be71652d) | [Discussion](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/epns-partnership-prize-notifications/2032)

**RabbitHole Community Votes:** 10 Yes / 0 No\
**Metagovernance Pod Votes:** 18 Yes / 0 No

Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) has proposed a partnership with PoolTogether to provide prize notifications on its network. RabbitHole voted unanimously to accept the proposal, as EPNS will significantly improve the UX at no cost. üëç

## Aave

#### Add $ENS to Aave V2

[Aave Governance v2](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/63-QmU4MH1mps19vXJzWeV555T6yhqX2sqSceaN1fkkxgFDe1) | [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-ens-as-collateral/6342?u=0xbilll)

**RabbitHole Community Votes:** 16 Yes / 0 No\
**Metagovernance Pod Votes:** 18 Yes / 0 No

The RabbitHole community and metagovernance pod voted 'Yes' to add $ENS to Aave V2! Our rationale in doing so was that ENS is a highly reputable contributor to the Ethereum Ecosystem. Additionally, we felt it was a great fit for both communities as both the Aave and ENS communities share members, and it made sense that ENS holders be able to deposit their ENS on Aave!
