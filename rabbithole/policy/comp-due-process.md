# Request for Feedback: Due Process for Compensation Decisions

[üó£Ô∏è Original Proposal on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/705527597425229885/932467375826157618/956251523258679306)\
[üìÑ v0 Compensation Breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T8n74jrGDrPqkPOLXBUr48aDKfJQM8pB4whv\_PpHsdc/edit#gid=1986919966)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Current Situation <a href="#abstract" id="abstract"></a>

A voting issue came to the attention of the Metagovernance pod on 3/23/22, requiring action by the entire pod on a highly contentious proposal.

The following events occurred:

* A tentative v0 compensation plan was discussed in a pod-wide call to address the allotment of funds for disbursal.
* A number of undisclosed contributors, in private discourse, drafted several changes to the proposed allotment.
* These changes were submitted to @lavande#3900, who created a vote in #mgp-general Discord channel for their ratification. ([Original discussion](https://discord.com/channels/705527597425229885/932467375826157618/956251523258679306))

The proposal body is as follows:

> hey @Metagovernance Pod! Since we have about 9 hours left in the feedback period for v0 comp, I thought I'd put forward some potential adjustments based on the concrete feedback we've received so far.
>
> * It was suggested that the passive participant compensation be lowered to $100 (from $250)
> * It was suggested that the active contributor compensation be lowered to $1,000 (from $1,250)
> * the remainder of the funds saved would go into the bonus pool to reward top contributors
>
> the intent behind these suggestions is to make sure that compensation levels accurately reflect the relative contribution level of each category and leave enough room for bonuses to compensate the very most active contributors.

The poll opened immediately and occurred over a 24-hour period. No notification/feedback period was allowed for the proposal prior to the poll, and little documentation (1 sentence) was presented to explain its purpose and rationale.

The particulars of the proposal appear to have been discussed in private with core team member/s only before presented for vote to the community.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Complications <a href="#problems" id="problems"></a>

#### Inadequate Time for Community Feedback <a href="#discussion-period" id="discussion-period"></a>

No community notification (rfc) period was given for this issue, and discussion/creation of the proposal was held in private. The vote was held over a span of 24 hours during a time in which several time-sensitive discussion periods were already underway, thereby adding to the strain and workload of carefully considering the issue and ongoing discussion.

Due to the lack of adequate time for discussion and consideration, at least one member made an erroneous vote **which resulted in a change of outcome** for this proposal.

A screenshot of the discussion can be found below:

![One member, who was not an active contributor but whose vote was counted, expressed an inability to interpret the proposal and make an informed decision within the time allotted. This resulted in an erroneous "Yes" vote which was never recalled. This person is not a native English speaker and lives in a non-American time zone, increasing the difficulty of voting on a short timeline.](../../.gitbook/assets/convo-screenshot.jpg)

Observance of a customary community notification (RFC) period prior to voting would have provided ample time for discussion and negotiation, allowing for a far less contentious discussion.

It should be noted that for this reason (among many others) submission of a proposal to governance without first undertaking a public comment period is typically considered bad practice and often results in the proposal being procedurally rejected where binding decisions are concerned.

#### Impact on Venue & Work Activity

The vote was held on Discord, unthreaded in the #mgp-general channel during a time when several time-sensitive discussions were underway (including general v1 planning). The short discussion window, impacted discussion venue and contentious nature of the proposal led to considerable difficulty tracking and participating in the ongoing discussion.

Being that this conversation was held in the general team coordination channel (without a dedicated discussion thread), this governance approach resulted in the disruption of usual discussion and activities related to the day-to-day operation of the pod during a time when preparation for the upcoming v1 season is an imminent priority.

#### Precedents for Future Decisions

Since this is the first compensation issue formally considered by the MGP, there is now an established precedent for last-minute compensation adjustments which adhere to no accepted best practice for good governance. This leaves an opportunity for future abuse or misuse of the MGP's governance system by bad actors. As such, additional effort now must be spent to address this policy deficit during a time when policy/role development is both an urgent necessity and a persistent contribution deficit.

Lack of consideration for due process and viable good governance procedure in the handling of internal proposals creates a double-standard for proposals considered by the pod. Such a double-standard is not only seemingly hypocritical and potentially dubious in nature, but also poses significant operational challenges in building and implementing effective policies and procedures within the pod.

### üîî Recommendation

To address the concerns described above, this author recommends that the MGP consider the following objectives to promote the practice of good governance, to prevent the misuse of the governance body, and to ensure fair compensation for future contributors:

#### Adherence to Due Process for All Compensation Decisions

* Full text (conformant to all proposal policies in use by the MGP) of all compensation-related proposals should be submitted _publicly_ for review by the community.
* A reasonable community notification period (conformant to all notification/RFC policies in use by the MGP: currently 24 hours) should be required before submission of any compensation-related proposals for vote.
* All compensation-related voting issues should be subject to the same voting policies and procedures governing external proposals considered by the MGP. This provides clarity around the voting process and prevents targeted abuse of internally generated proposals which would otherwise be held to less rigorous governance standards.

#### Standards for Integrity of Established Compensation Decisions

* Priority should be given to the creation and adoption of best practices and policies governing all decisions related to compensation.
* Priority should be given to the timely development of all relevant role, procedure and deliverable policies in order to ensure that work is being accurately described and compensated.
* Alteration or revocation of existing compensation arrangements should require a supermajority (2/3) vote (by all parties affected by the decision) for approval. This is to prevent violation of pre-existing compensation agreements while still enabling consensual policy changes as needed to ensure contributors are paid.

#### Trustless Vesting & Distribution for Base Rate Compensation

* Under no circumstances should contributions be solicited for compensation on a retroactive basis.
* All funds allocated for the compensation of specific roles should be vested and distributed using a secure, auditable and trustless system such as Sablier and Superfluid.
* Held, allocated funds which cannot be adequately vested (funds held for coordinape, future grants, etc.) should be held for safekeeping by a known responsible party (such as the core team) in a manner which cannot be impacted by the governance process until said funds are eligible for allocation.

#### Clearly Denominated Compensation for Deliverables and Bounties

* All compensation should be clearly described and denominated prior to solicitation of new contributors for v1.
* All deliverables entitled to compensation should be clearly described by policy and should not be assigned to contributors unless a specifically-denominated payment is pre-negotiated and agreed to by both parties.
* If appropriate compensation for a role or deliverable has not yet determined, no contributions should be solicited for those roles/deliverables until compensation is clarified.
