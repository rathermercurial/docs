# Request for Feedback: Metagov Pod Documentation Framework

## Request for Feedback: Metagov Pod Documentation Framework

[üîó WIP Documentation Framework](https://v0.rabbithole.rathermercurial.xyz)

Written by [rathermercurial.eth](https://rathermercurial.eth.xyz)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Current Documentation Complications

Currently the Metagovernance Pod uses a collection of Notion documents to define policies and operational guidelines. While this is sufficient for our purposes in v0, community and pod members have expressed difficulty navigating the Notion documentation and a desire to open-source more metagov content for use in onboarding and as a public good.

### üîî Potential Approach

In order to un-silo the MGP's key policies and operational information, I've created a WIP GitBook library to serve as a single, open source of truth for v1 documentation:

[RabbitHole Metagovernance Pod Documentation (WIP)](https://v0.rabbithole.rathermercurial.xyz)

[Documentation Framework Design Notes](https://docs.rathermercurial.xyz/rabbithole/policy/framework-notes)

Also included is an example policy framework designed as a minimum-viable solution to organize the MGP's rules and SOP's. I've compiled a framework of the following voting policies described or implied by current v0 pod docs in Notion:

[Metagov Pod Policy Framework](https://v0.rabbithole.rathermercurial.xyz/policies/core)

[Proposal Policy Framework](https://v0.rabbithole.rathermercurial.xyz/policies/voting/proposals)

This doc / policy framework, or an adaptation of it, could potentially be finished and adopted for use in v1.

### üí≠ Questions for Feedback

* Should this framework be adopted for use in v1?
* What changes are needed to make this useful / ready?
* What policies will be ready by v1?
* Who will write these policies?
