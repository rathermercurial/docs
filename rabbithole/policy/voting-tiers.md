# Request for Feedback: Voting Priority Tiers

[üó£Ô∏è Original Policy on Notion](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Tiering-Criteria-Final-Draft-v1-c7d93a5f3795467cba014b0e6107acc3)\
[‚úíÔ∏è Proposed Alternative Policy](https://v0.rabbithole.rathermercurial.xyz/policies/voting/proposals/criteria/priority)

Recommended by [rathermercurial.eth](https://rathermercurial.eth.xyz)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Current Situation

There is a [policy](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/Tiering-Criteria-Final-Draft-v1-c7d93a5f3795467cba014b0e6107acc3) currently under developing which governs the assessment of proposal priority based on various risk factors. This policy is designed to reduce voter fatigue and labor overhead caused by repetitive or routine proposals, as well as to aid in the scaling of voting operations.

The tiering policy is an omnibus document specifying two separate criteria (voting type and risk tier), each containing three tiers of parameters. These policy/parameter configurations make up a 9-point "Risk Matrix" used to assign a Priority Tier rating of 1-3.

Proposals assessed using the Risk Matrix are then subject to 1 of 3 additional policies (labeled "Voting Processes by Tier"), determined by their assigned Priority Tier. Each of these policies govern the selection of two separate voting policies (for community and pod votes, respectively). Two of the policies governing MGP voting contain undefined quorum variables (thus requiring the creation of an additional multi-threshold quorum policy), and the other references an as-yet undefined Consent-Based Governance policy.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Complications

Due to the complexity of the system described above, the difficulty of implementing well-defined procedures based on these policies is dramatically increased (by an order of magnitude). In the future, more complex policies must be created to comply with the high variability of complex policy outcomes, leading to the development of a non-scalable system.

In addition, several new sub-policies and variable parameters most be created to support this complexity, each implying yet more procedures to be developed (and assigned to contributor roles, at cost). Unnecessarily complex systems introduce new operational overhead, contributor fatigue and organizational fragility with no upside.

**Consider that this policy is \_untested**\_\*\* and thus there can be no evidence-based rationale for incorporating such a high degree of granularity and complexity into the voting procedure at this time.\*\*

The additional development of a hybrid Consent-Based Governance model (using voting with a 15% quorum threshold) is redundant because this is already accomplished earlier in the system through the mixed application of voting-based and consent-based governance methodologies during Voting Priority Tier Assessment phase.

### üîî Recommendation

I propose the adoption of an alternative model which _accomplishes the same purpose with far lesser complexity and operational overhead_, using conventional consent-based and voting-based governance methodologies with no complex variables or conditional statements.

* Separate the omnibus tiering policy by individual concern to create discreet, easy-to-understand policies citing well-defined SOP's:
  * [Risk Assessment Criteria](https://v0.rabbithole.rathermercurial.xyz/policies/voting/proposals/criteria/risk)
  * [Voting Priority Tiers](https://v0.rabbithole.rathermercurial.xyz/policies/voting/proposals/criteria/priority)
* Create a conventionally defined, consent-based governance policy which does _not_ incorporate a hybrid voting/quorum model to synthesize consensus.
* Merge redundant consent-based governance models into a single, pod-wide consent-based governance policy with no quorum threshold (as mentioned above).
* Eliminate variable quorum thresholds in favor of a single, pod-wide quorum policy.
* Clarify language used to differentiate Policies and Procedures for accessibility and accuracy.

A simpler system would serve the same end goal while reducing development time/costs and providing a more simple, accessible experience to new contributors.
