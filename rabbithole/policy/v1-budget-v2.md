### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Abstract

MGP has been working for several days to propose an operating budget for v1 of RabbitHole Metagovernance. Over the past 24 hours, a conversation has developed between contributors and the core team regarding budget expectations for v1 onward.

The following events occurred:

* Members of the MGP held contributor-only meetings on 4/4 - 4/5 to build a budget recommendation for v1. The pod collectively devised a total v1 budget of \~$300k. ([link](https://www.notion.so/rabbithole-gg/4-5-22-a911061b9d644130aba23ff728f182b3))
* In response, @benschecter advised the pod on the morning of 4/7/22 that RH core team had anticipated a budget of $100-150K for v1, and opened a dialogue around v1 compensation. ([link](https://discord.com/channels/705527597425229885/932467375826157618/961301062336266260))
* Several contributors expressed concern regarding Ben's suggestion, requesting clarification of the core team's expected outputs and goals for the MGP (still awaiting response).
* Ben suggested a revised v1 budget to the MGP ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NATcMc1f1W2T8qLAaFrOPIzdYoR\_kgoXmEn2bfhYpEM/edit#gid=0)), some aspects of which were met with concern from contributors questioning whether core team members have the proper context to suggest such significant budget revision.
* Seeking to create a more equitable budget proposal, member of the MGP convened in a series of meetings to co-create a revised budget proposal for consideration ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NATcMc1f1W2T8qLAaFrOPIzdYoR\_kgoXmEn2bfhYpEM/edit#gid=1103162582)).

A meeting has been scheduled for 4/7/22 to discuss v1 budget planning, during which time the MGP intends to propose a counter-offer for consideration by the core team. Details of the proposed budget are described in this document.

### üí¨ Metagovernance Pod Feedback

* Throughout v0 the MGP has advocated for an open dialogue with the core in order to better define expected outputs and operating parameters (such as budget guidelines). Without this data the pod is unable to accurately plan and communicate a workable strategy for v1.
* Many pod members have expressed concern that the core team has under-valued the labor provided by contributors, as well as the strategic importance to RabbitHole's core mission and product use case. Over the past several months the MGP has become a centerpiece of RabbitHole's marketing narrative and overall product direction. We believe this gives us sufficient negotiating leverage to request a more substantial budget for v0.
* All pod members expressed concerns that the core team's v1 budget guidelines are insufficient in terms of driving successful outcomes and delivering on the MGP's mandated goal of becoming top delegates and leaders in the metagovernance space.
* Several of the most active contributors have expressed desire to down tools on certain pod activities or seek more rewarding contribution opportunities at other organizations. Budget compromise is needed in order to retain the MGP's talent pool.

### ü§ù Proposed Budget Compromise

Due to the MGP's strategic importance to RabbitHole's go-to-market strategy and product use case, combined with the pod's growing social capital and recognition within the metagovernance space, the pod believes we are positioned to negotiate for a happy-medium compromise with the RH core team at a total investment of **\~$228k** for Metagovernance Version 1.

We propose the following adjustments to the current v1 charter and budget in order to equitably accommodate RabbitHole's spending capacity:

* Reduce Scope of Work for v1
  * Eliminate "Nice to Have" bounties and pod-wide projects
  * Outsourcing of non-essential outputs with revenue-generating potential to the community (as defined below)
* Eliminate Non-Essential Roles
  * Reduce R\&E Co-Lead Count to 1
  * Eliminate Technical Specialist Role
  * Eliminate Policy Writer Role
  * Eliminate Branding Specialist Role
  * Reduce Scribe count to 1
* Reduce Workload for Remaining Roles
  * Reduce T3 roles from 15 to 10 hrs/wk
  * Reclassify Process Specialist and Creators as T3 Roles
* Create a sovereign Governance Mining Guild for Out-of-Scope Projects & Bounties
* Proposed Payroll Budget: **$205,200**
* Total Concessions Made: $112,800

#### Delegation of Remaining Responsibilities to Community

In order to deliver on a reasonably competitive and effective scope of work for v1, co-leads and project-based contributors will be required to dedicate time and personal resources above and beyond the current scope of work and compensation. We believe this additional work to be mission-critical and vital to the MGP's success and alignment with RH's stated objectives and business model.

We request the additional allocation of **1 Ether** and **20,000 USDC** to a community-governed multisig wallet controlled by the MGP Pathfinder Committee. These funds will be deployed as part of a governance mining strategy to position contributors as strategic, value-added investors by providing flexible, on-demand human capital, governance and go-to-market resources in exchange for fair access to RabbitHole's future governance token or equity allocations.

MGP contributors will form a voluntary, soverign service guild to deploy allocated funds for the fulfillment of the following goals (as funding and availability allow):

* Coordination and fulfillment of all project-based tasks ("Bounties") such as:
  * Research deliverables related to core aspects of MGP activity
  * Ad-hoc requests for tooling evaluation and implementation
  * Ad-hoc bounties for community-generated educational content
  * Translation of key content into Chinese language(s)
* Design and implementation of Delegation & External Proposal Strategies
* Design and implementation of governance tooling via a bespoke PaaS/GaaS model
* Development and publication of open-source frameworks and other contributor-owned IP
* Research and development of onboarding strategies for the MGP and partner protocols
* Research and development of go-to-market strategies and partnerships to provide additional revenues and other forms of value expansion.

Outputs and KPI's will be tracked and made available to RabbitHole for the purpose of measuring the guild's positive impact and negotiating allocation of governance responsibilities wen/if token drop.

#### RabbitHole's Total v1 Investment

In order to provide the greatest value to RabbitHole and uphold our hard-earned reputation for governance excellence in our industry, the Metagovernance Pod proposes the following budget for v1:

* v1 Payroll Budget: **$205,200**
* Community Ops Budget: **\~$23,000**
* Proposed Total v1 Budget: **\~$228,200**
