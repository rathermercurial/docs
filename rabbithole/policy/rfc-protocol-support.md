# Request for Feedback: Metagovernance Protocol Support Role (WIP)

In v0, functionality of the Metagovernance Pod (MGP) often relies on close collaboration between elected protocol specialists and a flexible group of volunteer contributors. We propose to formalize these contributions under the "Protocol Support" role in v1.

This role will actively support the operations of the MGP while providing a reliable recruitment channel for high-quality governance contributors. Qualified contributors will be selected from self-nominees within the RabbitHole community by the elected Metagovernance Commitee Members. Protocol specialists should have final say in assignment of support staff to their protocol.

### 💼Responsibilities

The Protocol Specialist Support role serves to aid the protocol specialists by providing timely content creation and research support, reacting in a timely manner to all new proposals within the voting pipeline.

#### Source information for proposal recommendations

The protocol support role is responsible for gathering all basic information related to new proposals in the pipeline.

* Monitor governance platforms daily and initiate new proposals within the workstream pipeline.
* Harvest data from new proposals and surface any missing details needed for recommendations.
* Prepare proposal summaries for the Protocol Specialist in a timely manner as new proposals are submitted.

#### Surface feedback and provide relevant educational resources

* Record Community feedback from Discord and other channels
* Anticipate, discover and record questions from community channels.
* Enrich proposal content with supporting links and answers to common questions.

### 🏆Requirements

The Protocol Support role is vital to the day-to-day operations of the MGP and thus contributors should be held to a reasonable expectation of performance.

#### Availability & Punctuality

The Protocol Support role requires contributors to provide a relatively high degree of availability and time management. Contributors should attend all weekly sync calls and other meetings in order to maintain context across all MGP workstreams.

Protocol Support contributors must be able to monitor all governance channels for new proposals and begin work quickly once new proposals are submitted. Effort should be made to ensure that work is delivered in a timely manner to ensure the smooth and swift operation of the MG workflow.

#### Accurate & Consistent Output

Due to the both the unpredictable nature of the MG workload and the overall demands of good governance practices, the Protocol Support contributors must adhere closely to all MGP best practices and endeavor to consistently produce a high-quality content for immediate use by the MGP.

All deliverables (proposal summaries, due diligence reports, supplemental content, etc.) should be made available to protocol specialists in a convenient and ready-to-use format. Effort should be made to adapt to and support the Protocol Specialist's workflow wherever possible.

#### High-Context Perspective

Protocol Support contributors must be able to quickly engage, understand, summarize and ELI5 a wide variety of governance proposals and conversations across a wide range of protocols and web3 use cases.

Contributors should be required to meet a minimum standard of participation in DeFi, Web3 and the RabbitHole community to be eligible for the Protocol Support role.

### 💰Benefits

#### Published On-Chain Contributions

Protocol Support contributors will have the opportunity to immediately start writing proposals for RabbitHole MGP (and eventually RabbitHole Dao), building a relevant history of on-chain governance contributions.

Contributors will also develop metagovernance processes and best practices, communicating with other metagovernance bodies and the web3 community at large. RabbitHole will help contributors leverage these contributions and credentials to secure valuable opportunities with our protocol partners and other governance orgs.

#### Monetary Compensation

Scalable, value-aligned compensation models for protocol support contributors can be achieved through implementation of revenue-earning governance activities such as Governance Mining, Dao Recruitment, Governance-as-a-Service and more.

By providing these accessible, competitive contribution opportunities, RabbitHole can achieve greater traction and recognition as a leader in decentralized human capital services for the new paradigm of work.

> Due to the unpredictable demands of the Protocol Support role, this author recommends that RabbitHole adopt a hybrid compensation model for these contributions. For example:
>
> * One pre-negotiated monthly stipend, divided equally among all Protocol Support contributors
> * Individual, value-aligned stablecoin bounties and/or governance incentives for each proposal or other valuable deliverable.
>
> Monthly stipends would be equal, and large enough to fairly compensate even those who contribute the least. Proposal bounties should be large enough to compensate for the role's highly variable workload and to incentivize timely, high quality work and collaboration.
