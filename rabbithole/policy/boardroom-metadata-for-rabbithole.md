# Boardroom Metadata for RabbitHole

### Instructions

To add an organization to the Boardroom index, you'll need to fill out a typeform located within their documentation. Below you'll find most of the information needed to set up a boardroom account. You'll need to add your preferred brand message into the `description` field and enter the Discourse URL's if used. I've double-checked on their discord to make sure this is the correct configuration, but documentation is limited so ðŸ¤·

#### Overview File

[Full Overview Instructions Here](https://github.com/boardroom-inc/protocol-Info/blob/main/protocols/indexCoop/overview.md)

Each Boardroom profile page must have an overview file written in markdown. This is an opportunity to show off RabbitHole's brand and explain its meta/governance process.

[Index Coop's overview page](https://github.com/boardroom-inc/protocol-Info/blob/main/protocols/indexCoop/overview.md) is a great example to use for inspiration. You can grab their markdown file on Github, or ping me in chat with a link to your content and I'll write one up.

It's a good idea to use a reliable host for any images in the document. I use Pinata's IPFS pinning service.
